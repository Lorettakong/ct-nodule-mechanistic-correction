# Uncertainty-Aware Mechanistic Misspecification Correction for Sparse Longitudinal CT-Derived Lung Nodule Trajectory Prediction

This repository contains the code, processed tables, and manuscript-facing
outputs for the study.

The study evaluates sparse three-scan lung nodule trajectory prediction using
CT-derived measurements from the NLSTt dataset. The proposed framework uses a
Bayesian Gompertz model as an interpretable mechanistic backbone, learns a
regularized population-level mechanistic deviation correction from pre-holdout
trajectory features, and applies conformal calibration to improve predictive
interval reliability.

## What Is Included

- NLSTt three-scan cohort construction utilities and processed modeling tables
- Bayesian Gompertz-guided mechanistic deviation correction code
- Simple longitudinal, data-driven, mechanistic, and residual-neural baseline
  comparison outputs
- Conformal calibration and uncertainty evaluation outputs
- Manuscript-facing figures and tables for the BSPC submission
- MAP-based robustness outputs on all 8603 eligible three-scan NLSTt
  trajectories

## Key Results

On the stratified NLSTt-300 three-scan evaluation cohort, the Bayesian
Gompertz backbone achieved a log-volume RMSE of `0.5662` and a
volume-space MAE of `0.8551 cm^3`. The proposed mechanistic correction
framework achieved a log-volume RMSE of `0.5279` and a volume-space MAE
of `0.7636 cm^3`, corresponding to relative improvements of `6.8%` and
`10.7%`, respectively.

After conformal calibration, empirical 95% coverage improved from `0.600`
for the original Bayesian Gompertz intervals to `0.950` for the proposed
calibrated intervals, with interval score decreasing from `12.1614` to
`8.4727`.

The supplemental MAP-based robustness experiment on all `8603` eligible
three-scan trajectories is stored in:

## Reproducibility Notes

The repository includes processed NLSTt-derived tables used for the manuscript
analyses. The CT-derived volumes are approximate ellipsoidal volumes computed
from NLSTt nodule extents, not pathologically confirmed malignant tumor
burden.

Raw NLST CT images are not included. The processed tables and manuscript-facing
outputs are provided so readers can inspect the cohort construction,
prediction results, statistical comparisons, and figures reported in the
paper.
